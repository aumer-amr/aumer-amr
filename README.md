# Just another engineer
I'm a software engineer based in The Netherlands, yet these days i'm coding way less more, and instead designing more (sad puppy face). Hopefully in the future time will allow me to get back into actual coding. Projects on here are usually quick and dirty projects unless specified otherwise, but feel free to browse, use, and improve them within the bounds of their licenses.

## Contact
If you want to contact me, the best place would be Discord (Aumer#1337).
